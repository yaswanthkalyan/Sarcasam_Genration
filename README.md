Project Title: Sarcasm Generation Framework with Sentiment Analysis and Commonsense Reasoning

Overview:
This repository contains the implementation and detailed documentation of a sarcasm generation framework developed by Saketh Ram Kalavakuntla, Hari Krishna Kamana, and Yaswanth Kalyan Ponugoti. The framework integrates advanced techniques in sentiment analysis and commonsense reasoning to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of generating sarcastic sentences in natural language processing systems.

Key Modules:

Sentiment Neutralization:

Filters sentiment-laden words from input text to create a neutral backdrop for sarcasm generation.
Positive Sentiment Induction:

Introduces positive sentiment to create incongruity with the input sentence, setting the stage for sarcasm.
Retrieval of Commonsense:

Enhances sarcasm by adding additional context that contradicts the introduced positive sentiment.
Concatenation:

Reinforces the sarcastic tone by juxtaposing positive sentiment with incongruent context, highlighting the disparity between appearance and reality.
Datasets Used:

Sentiment Data Corpus
Positive Dataset
Negative Sentiment Corpora
Model Architecture:

The Sentiment Neutralization module employs a neural network with LSTM layers and self-attention mechanisms for sentiment classification.
Integration of the COMET DISTIL model, specifically focusing on the xEffect relation, improves contextual understanding and enhances sarcastic effect in generated sentences.
Methodology:

The methodology includes multiple steps such as Sentiment Neutralization, Positive Sentiment Induction, Commonsense retrieval, and Concatenation modules.
Future improvements involve addressing missing context, conducting user studies for evaluation, and exploring advanced language models for enhanced sentence generation.
Usage:

Clone the repository and follow the documentation to set up and run the sarcasm generation framework.
Detailed instructions for training, evaluation, and model deployment are provided in the documentation.
